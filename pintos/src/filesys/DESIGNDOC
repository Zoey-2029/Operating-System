>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode

Inode staucture would support 10 direct blocks, 1 indirect block 
and 1 double indirect block, so the file size supported is:
Level 0 -- 10 sectors * 512 bytes per sector 
          = 5120 bytes
Level 1 -- 1 indirect block * 128 sectors * 512 bytes per sector 
          = 65536 bytes
Level 2 -- 1 doubly indirect blocks * 128 indirect blocks *
            65536 bytes per indirect block
          = 8388608 bytes
Total   -- 8459264 bytes


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

When a process wants to write to a file, it will first check if current 
write would extend the file. If so, one process get the lock of that 
inode allocate empty blocks and modify the file length. So when two 
processes both wants to extend a file, lock of that inode would protest 
them from extending the file at the same time.

If a process tries to write to a file, it will get the lock of that 
inode, releases the lock when it finished writing the file. So in our
design, the reader can only see all or none of what B writes. 

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".

Becasue reading a file doesn't affect the inode structure, so the 
reading process won't get a lock and will not indefinitely block writers.
And writers, no matter whether they get the lock, they will not block 
readers since the reader doesn't need to get the lock to read files.

Our inode structure is a multilevel index, it contains 10 direct 
blocks, 1 indirect block and 1 double indirect block. We choose this
particular combination because it is large eoungh to support a 8M file. 
In fact, we can modify the static variables declared above to get a 
different combination based on our needs, only if the size of 
disk_inode preserves as a block size.

			     BUFFER CACHE
			     ============

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct cache_entry
{
  block_sector_t sector;
  struct list_elem elem;      /* list element for frame table */
  struct list_elem read_elem; /* list element for frame table */
  char data[BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE];
  bool dirty;
  bool loaded;
  bool accessed;
  struct semaphore sema;
};

The cache_entry struct saves the data we need for using the cache table.

static struct list cache;
static struct list read_ahead_list; /* List of entries to read ahead. */
static int cache_size = 0;
static bool evict_cache (void);          /* LRU eviction for cache. */
static struct lock cache_lock;           /* Lock for cache table. */
static struct lock read_ahead_lock;      /* Lock for read ahead. */
static struct semaphore read_ahead_sema; /* Sema for read ahead. */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

We implemented the LRU algorithm with second chance. When an cache entry is 
accessed, we set the accessed bit to 1. When evicting, if the bit is 1, 
we set it to 0 and pushed to the back (second change). If access bit is 0 and
the entry is fully loaded from read_ahead or read, we can safely write to disk and 
evict the cache.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

As the cache table gets initialized, the program will start a 
separate thread with function write_behind.

This thread will run an inifinite loop, write dirty cache to disk and 
go to sleep using timer_sleep(). 

Dirty caches are marked by the dirty 
bit in the cache_entry, when a write happens the corresponding cache 
will be set to dirty, allowing write behind to write to disk.


>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

As the cache table gets initialized, the program will start a separate 
thread that goes to sleep by default. 

The thread only wake up if we need read ahead and sema is up on read_ahead_sema;
The read_ahead_list contains what are needed to be read ahead, the thread will
read those, the loaded to true so other threads know the cache is loaded.

After finishing reading, the thread will go back sleep by sema_down, waiting to
wake up again.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

We have a cache_lock that needs to be acquired when performing
any task on the cache table. Thus if a process is reading or writing,
other processes will wait until the action finishes before they can
possibly start evicting the buffer cache block.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

Eviction only happends when we try to insert a cache block,
which requires the lock on the cache table. 

Other processes will need to acquire the cache lock before 
accessing this block, and the lock is only relased after the eviction is 
finished.

Thusother processes are prevented from attempting to access the block until 
eviction is finished.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

Buffer caching: If a file needs to be read and written multiple times 
in a short time period, the workload will benefit a lof 
since we do not have to perform many disk operations, 
just need to update the cache.

Read-ahead: when a workload is loading a large sequential file,
it is going to benefit since read-ahead allow us to load the info before hand,
and saves time.

Write-behind: when a workload modifies certain files/sectors many times,
it is going to benefit since instead of writing immediately with many disk ops,
we write-behind when the updates are finished.
