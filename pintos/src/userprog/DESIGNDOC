---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

/* file_info struct keeps track of the opened file and its fd. */
struct file_info
{
  int fd;
  struct list_elem elem;
  struct file *file;
};

/* Lock to make sure only one process can interact with filesys. */
static struct lock filesys_lock;

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

1. File descriptors (fd) and open files (*file) are both members of the 
file_info struct. When a file is opened, the program creates a
file_info struct and inserts it to the file_info_list of the thread.
With this design, given a fd, to find a file associated, we just need
to check the list and see if there exists a file_info struct that has
the same fd and returns the *file store in this struct.

2. File descriptors are unique within a single process. Common Unix 
system implements per-process file descriptor table so we implement 
our file descriptors in the similar way.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the

>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

>> B6: Any access to user program memory at a user-specified address
>> can fail due to a bad pointer value.  Such accesses must cause the
>> process to be terminated.  System calls are fraught with such
>> accesses, e.g. a "write" system call requires reading the system
>> call number from the user stack, then each of the call's three
>> arguments, then an arbitrary amount of user memory, and any of
>> these can fail at any point.  This poses a design and
>> error-handling problem: how do you best avoid obscuring the primary
>> function of code in a morass of error-handling?  Furthermore, when
>> an error is detected, how do you ensure that all temporarily
>> allocated resources (locks, buffers, etc.) are freed?  In a few
>> paragraphs, describe the strategy or strategies you adopted for
>> managing these issues.  Give an example.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

1. In our design, the process does not reuse file descriptors if a file is
closed. 
The advantage is that it's very easy to assign new file 
descriptors without having to go back and find available fds.
This could be an issue if a process open a large amount of files. However, 
since we define fd as an int which can go up to 2,147,483,647 on modern 
machines, it's very unlikely that the fd could go out of bouds.

2. In our design, each process has a list of file_info structs. 
The advantage is to utilizes existing list functions so it's easier to 
implement. 
But this requires the program to go through the list to find the file 
mathing the pid, which could be slow if a process has a large amount of 
opened, unclosed files.


>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future quarters or the remaining projects?

>> Any other comments?
